        <title>Welcome to cooking without recipes: find confidence in the kitchen!</title>
        <p>
          Are you new to cooking or tired of following complicated recipes?
          You're in the right place! My name is Cameron, and I'm here to help you learn the art of cooking without a recipe.
          With a background in self-taught cooking, I've learned how to create tasty meals just from memory.
          Growing up, my love for cooking started in the church kitchen, where I’d help make big dinners each week.
          One day, craving a meal I hadn't had in years, I recreated a tater-tot casserole perfectly from memory.
          That day, I realized how easy it can be to cook with just a little confidence, a handful of ingredients,
          and a simple mindset. Now, I'm here to share this skill with you!

        <title>Learning to cook with "Skeleton Recipes!"</title>
        <p>
          If you're a young adult, a new graduate living alone, or just someone who’s never felt at home in the kitchen,
          my approach will guide you step-by-step. Instead of strict recipes, I'll introduce you to "skeleton recipes."
          These are flexible meal ideas where you get to decide what to add, using whatever ingredients you have on hand.
          It’s all about confidence and experimenting—think of it as a choose-your-own-adventure for cooking!
