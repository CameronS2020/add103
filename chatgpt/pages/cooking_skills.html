        <title>learning core skills</title>
        <p>
            Learning a few core skills can help you cook confidently without needing a recipe every time.
            Here, we’ll cover three key skills: choosing the right tools, picking ingredients wisely,
            and using spices effectively.
        </p>
        <title>the three big skills.</title>
        <p>
            First, let’s talk tools. No need for brand-name items,
            but understanding how each tool works can be a game-changer.
            For example, a wok heats up faster than a regular pan, which is great for quickly cooking
            stir-fries or even soups and chili. Experiment with what you have; sometimes,
            breaking the rules (like making chili in a wok) leads to surprising results!

            Next, choosing ingredients is key, especially when using older food.
            Make sure ingredients are safe to eat—avoid moldy items or anything that smells off.
            However, slightly aged ingredients can often still be delicious.
            For example, day-old bread is perfect for French toast, but you wouldn’t want to use it for a fresh sandwich.
             Balance older ingredients with fresher ones to make the most of everything.

            Finally, spices can make or break a dish. A dash of garlic or onion powder adds depth to savory foods,
            while a pinch of sugar balances the acidity in tomato sauce. Experiment with different combinations—try
            a sprinkle of basil on scrambled eggs or some minced garlic in your pasta sauce.
            Remember, seasoning is all about your personal taste, so don’t be afraid to explore and discover what you like.
