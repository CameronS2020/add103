        <title>What are skeleton recipes all about?</title>
        <p>
            Skeleton recipes are all about flexibility, creativity,
            and making the most of what you already have in the kitchen.
            Think of them as basic outlines instead of strict instructions, which lets you add your own spin on meals.
            A skeleton recipe could be as simple as turning boxed mac and cheese into a hearty dish by tossing in
            extra veggies, bacon bits, or a dash of hot sauce.
            Or maybe you take last night’s garlic bread, add some cheese and deli meat, and make a delicious sandwich!
            Feeling bold? Try your hand at a homemade pizza from scratch all you have to do  is make dough, 
            letting you spend the real effort on choosing every topping you want to, making it truly your own.

        <title>Getting started with skeleton recipes.</title>
        <p>
            To get started with skeleton recipes, try to keep these three ingredients stocked in your pantry: olive oil, pasta,
            and a basic protein like chicken, beef, or tofu.
            These essentials work with a wide variety of add-ons to create satisfying meals.
            For instance, leftover Italian sausage can easily become taco filling with just a sprinkle of taco seasoning.
            Or, if you have stale bread, dip it in beaten eggs, fry it up, and voilà—French toast! The beauty of
            skeleton recipes is minimizing both cost and waste, transforming forgotten ingredients into tasty meals.
            So, get creative and remember: make haste, not waste.
