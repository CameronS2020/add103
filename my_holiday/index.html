            <h2>Costume Contest</h2>
            <p>
                The holders of the event "Me and my compatriots" will be the judges of all party attenders costumes (automatic 0 if you're wearing normal clothes.)
                We'll be judging on 3 different things, originalliyu, creativity, and execution.
                and at the end of the party, we'll be rewarding the winner of the costume party a halloween themed cake to take home with them.

                <p>
                    There will be a space where we try to seperate the music and atmosphere of the party off, allowing people to rest.
                    Within the resting room, there will be a tv for people who want to spend their halloween watching movies scary or not.
                    We will do our best to provide food and snacks IN the resting room for our less socially gifted.
