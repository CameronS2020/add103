            <p>
                The holders of the event "Me and my compatriots" will be the judges of all party attenders costumes (automatic 0 if you're wearing normal clothes.)
                We'll be judging on 3 different things, originallity, creativity, and execution.
                and at the end of the party, we'll be rewarding the winner of the costume party a halloween themed cake to take home with them.

                    There will be a space where we try to seperate the music and atmosphere of the party off, allowing people to rest.
                    Within the resting room, there will be a tv for people who want to spend their halloween watching movies scary or not.
                    We will do our best to provide food and snacks IN the resting room for our less socially gifted guests.

                    We will stay vigilant that the punch bowl stays unspiked, we will remain unmoved by attempts to 
                    hot box a room, we will insure, that all the fun had on this hallows eve is legal and kosher.

                <p>Most importantly, we hope that everyone has fun, we have no people limit, but if people start packing outside of the door,
                    we'd obviously want to keep the doors shut for the niehgbors. Invite as many people as you want, and do your best 
                    to enjoy yourselves. See you there! address123, at 12:12PM Oct,31st.
