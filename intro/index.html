    <h1>Cameron's introduction</h1>
    <p>
        The reason i'm taking this class is i'm pursuing a future in video game design and video game programming.
        I've always been interested in learning how things are made and programming is one i've been meaning to learn for a long time.
        And most importantly, I need classes like this under my belt to graduate.

    <h2>Camerons hobbies</h2>
    <h3>Gaming</h3>

        <p>
            I started gaming pretty much before i could start walking.
            My grandma who I lost at the beginning of this year, used to baby sit me all the time, and had a collection of retro games that allowed me to absorb many genres at an early age.
            My favorite console growing up was the super nintendo, spawning a love for my favorite game series, "Kirby".
            As of lately, most of my time gaming is going towards multiplayer games with my new family, such as "Fortnite" or that new game by valve, "Deadlock".
            It's always been a passion of mine and hopefully it can become my job.
        </p>
    <h3>Youtube</h3>
        <p>
            watching youtube, just like gaming, started very early in my life.
            As early as the first few videos by smosh when youtube was just beginning to get it's footing as a platform.
            It's transformed heavily over time, and rarely do I find myself engaged deeply in anything but music.
            But one of my favorite things to do of late, to stick my adhd riddled brain in place is watch marine life documentaries.
            I've been considering doing video game analysis videos myself for a while, but not sure if it's a good idea to do that before becoming a developer myself.

    <h3>Cooking</h3>
        <p>
            My love for cooking starts at a very innocent place in my past.
            Beginning at the church which my heart for religion still lies within.
            I was the only white family in an all black church, and it was a mixing pot of people and personalities.
            No time did I ever feel so connected with people than on every wednesday and sunday, where we made and shared a dinner with every member of the church.
            half of my homemade recipes, are ones I inherited from watching the other members of the church make in the small cramped church kicthen.
