        <p>
            Cooking is one of my greatest passions. You might think that someone of my size and love for food would 
            enjoy cooking, and you'd be right! I love exploring new seasonings and ingredients and perfecting dishes 
            I've made countless times. Unlike most people, I rarely follow recipes. Instead, I experiment with different 
            methods and containers until I'm satisfied with the result.

            One of my favorite things to make is sandwiches. I could see myself happily working in a sub shop, 
            introducing new cuts of meat, and experimenting with dressings and sauces. That's probably why Epic 
            Deli is one of my favorite places to eat. Cooking, for me, is an adventure, and I love sharing that 
            adventure with my family and friends.

            When I cook, I feel a sense of freedom. I don't like being tied down to recipes. 
            I prefer to experiment and find my own way. Sometimes, this means trying a new seasoning or cooking 
            something in a different type of dish. It might not always turn out perfect, but that's part of the fun. 
            I learn something new every time I cook, and it makes me a better chef.

            One of my favorite things to make in the kitchen is sandwiches. I could see myself happily working in a 
            sub shop, creating delicious subs with fresh ingredients. I love trying out different kinds of bread, meats,
            cheeses, and sauces. Each combination offers a new taste experience. 
            That's probably why Epic Deli is one of my favorite restaurants. They always have unique and 
            tasty sandwiches that inspire me to try new ideas in my kitchen.
