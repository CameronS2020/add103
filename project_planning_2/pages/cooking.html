            Hi there! I'm Cameron. Over the past three years, my life has transformed from merely surviving to 
            truly living. I've found people I can proudly call my family and a place where I always feel welcomed 
            and supported. The holidays, which used to be a time I'd isolate myself, are now filled with joy and 
            togetherness. Taking a day off feels like a privilege rather than a chore.
        </p>
