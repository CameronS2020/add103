        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
            Hi there! I'm Cameron. Over the past three years, my life has transformed from merely surviving to 
            truly living. I've found people I can proudly call my family and a place where I always feel welcomed 
            and supported. The holidays, which used to be a time I'd isolate myself, are now filled with joy and 
            togetherness. Taking a day off feels like a privilege rather than a chore.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm a collector of things that bring me happiness. I follow the "Sparking Joy" philosophy, where I only 
          keep or buy things that genuinely make me happy. My collection includes plushies from arcades, art prints, 
          and unique collector's items like Kratos's Blades of Chaos. These items aren't just things to me; 
          they represent memories and joys in my life.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the best parts about my life now is having a support system. My friends are like my family, 
          and I know I can always count on them. We have fun together, whether it's playing games, cooking meals, 
          or just hanging out. This sense of belonging has made a huge difference in my life. I no longer feel alone, 
          and I look forward to the future with excitement.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also love collecting items that make me smile. Whether it's a plushie I won at an arcade, 
          a beautiful art print, or a cool collector's item like Kratos's Blades of Chaos, these things bring joy to 
          my life. Each item in my collection has a story and a special meaning to me. They remind me of fun times and 
          achievements, and they add color and happiness to my daily life.
        </p>
