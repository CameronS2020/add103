<!--- I used Chatgpt to help me write my paragraphs, but it basically gave me what I put in, for proof, here is the link
https://chatgpt.com/share/67159c9e-5e40-800b-a488-f23fec2a3e6c (I tried to be in depth while not being too specific but I think I just ended up writing my paragraphs.)
I used pixabay for one of my images, the gamecube controller picture.--->

        <p>
          Hello, my name is Cameron, and I'm 22 years old. My birthday is in July. I'm currently a college student, studying to become a Video Game Designer. 
          Some of my favorite hobbies are gaming, cooking, and working on or appreciating art, especially animation.
          Growing up, I didn't have the easiest childhood. But from it, I developed a love for video games and animation, which got me through tough times. 
          My life really began when I turned 18. I moved out of my fourth foster home and into the house of a middle school friend. 
          Now, I'm considered the sixth brother in their family. After moving in, I gave college another shot and am now working hard to balance life and my classes.
