    <!--Add a paragraph describing what you are going to review. This should be 2-3 sentences -->
    <P>
        I'm going to be reviewing one of my favorite creators games of all time, Hylics 2. 
        A game that's made solely by a programming artist, and a freelancing musician. 
        Mason Lindroth and Chuck Salamone created an experience out of clay and guitars that changed my life creatively.
    </P>

    <!--Add a H2 tag describing characters, game play, or some specific part of your review-->
<h2>Being a turned base rpg, made in rpg maker, the gameplay is simple, but the <em>atmosphere is deep</em>.</h2>
    <!--Add a paragraph about whatever your H2 tag was-->
<P> The game is mostly composed of real life captured claymation, using graphic filters the slow and macabre motions of the clat create unique animation.
    The music throughout the game is this strange mixture of inorganic beeps and a soothing guitar and drum that whips the senses between unease and comfort.
    The experience of playing this game isn't from it's optional combats but the sheer oddities witnessed throughout the journey, a game that hits like a piece of art.
</P>
    <!--Add an H3 tag about a scene or character, include a quote in the paragraph-->
<h3>The characters are immortal, cycles start end and repeat.</h3>

<p>from the first game, to the second game, to the album linking the 2nd and the upcoming third game, the story is based around cycles repeating.
    when you die in the game, your flesh melts off of you and you wake up in the afterlife, and just go back to the world.
    the villain keeps coming back, because nothing truly dies. and the end of this game sets up something important, the villain stops coming back, and the unrepeated cycle, leads into the 3rd game.
